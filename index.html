    <p>I am a product, web, and graphic designer leading projects and teams through design processes with radical collaboration.
    <p>I believe in inclusive, fast-loading, and sustainable apps and websites that solve problems for people. As a conceptual thinker, I am passionate about designing images and identities using web technologies, typography, and generative <abbr>AI</abbr>.
    <p>With an <abbr title="master of arts">MA</abbr> degree in design theory and a background in front-end development and marketing, I facilitate collaboration between designers, engineers, and product teams to reach better business outcomes.
    <p>I have shaped the products, communication, and image of some of the most famous brands, and have been exhibited at national design events multiple times. I have led startup projects and the <abbr>AI</abbr> research team at <a href="https://ergomania.eu/">Ergomania</a>. I am currently designing financial apps at <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a>.
    <p>In my spare time, I research and give talks about graphic design history, design books and graphics, and develop open-source websites for cultural and university institutions.

            <p>Bantu is a British financial social app that focuses on social interactions for young adults to handle expenses more easily at outings and group planning. The challenge was to redesign the information architecture based on the product vision in a way that is still familiar to financial app users. We used generative <abbr>AI</abbr> for branding and deviated from the all-too-common minimalist <abbr>UI</abbr> and brand design direction to appeal to our target audience.

        <img src="/img/gergo-zambo-designer-portrait.avif" width="350" height="350" alt="Portrait of Gergő Zámbó">
        <p>I am a product, web, and graphic designer leading projects and teams through design processes to create business value and solve problems.
        <p>With over ten years of experience, I have collaborated on high-impact, large projects for some of the most famous companies.
        <p>I have redesigned global brands at <a href="https://www.vml.com/"><abbr title="Valentine, McCormick, Ligibel">VML</abbr></a>, led an <abbr>AI</abbr> research group at one of the first <abbr>UX</abbr> agencies in Hungary, and led product design on <abbr title="governance, risk, and compliance">GRC</abbr> apps at <a href="https://www.diligent.com/">Diligent</a>. I am currently working at <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a> as a senior <abbr>UX</abbr> designer.
        <p>I facilitate discussions between design, engineering, and product teams through my background in front-end technologies and marketing. People know me for my proactive, straightforward, and to-the-point work ethic.
        <p>I believe that understanding the people, businesses, systems, and the historical context of design artifacts enables you to devise more varied solutions during design processes of all kinds.
        <p>When my time and energy allow, I design books, help institutions with communication and design problems, research Hungarian graphic design, and develop open-source literary websites to give back to my local community.

          <h4>Website info</h4>
          <p>Manifesto, history, and design decisions
        </hgroup>
        <p>If you wonder why my website looks like a title page from the 18th century, it is because this was my goal. It might look utterly boring to today’s standards, but playing around with the rich typographical heritage of book design in a digital medium was what got me interested.
        <p>It draws inspiration from sustainable web design with a love for transitional Scotch typefaces. I started with the self-imposed design constraint to use only Georgia. It is sustainable and one of the best fonts ever made for screens.
        <p>The source code of this website is substantially less than the current average page size reference. It uses mobile-first <abbr title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> and responsive typography techniques. It validates ﬂawlessly and is accessible to a wide range of users.

        <dl>
          <dt>What’s with all the ampersands?</dt>
          <dd>I have used ampersands at more places than some might find healthy. I have used these to make the headings more compact. Contrary to common knowledge, conjunctions are allowed at the beginning and the end of lines in titles. This typographic debate is still ongoing and undecided. After much reading, I took the liberty of using them at both the beginning and at the end of lines.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>Why don’t you have a light mode?</dt>
          <dd>Light mode helps legibility in bright environments. However, I wanted to keep the code as lightweight as possible, and a dark background uses less energy. For this reason, I opted out of a theme switcher to be more sustainable and a bit less accessible.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt>You know that there is more to design than generating business value, right?</dt>
          <dd>I am aware. I try to do my fair share of pro-social and cultural work outside my working hours. If I can make a difference on a larger scale and generate business value in one place, that is even better.</dd>
        </dl>
